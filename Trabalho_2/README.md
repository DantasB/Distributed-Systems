## About

This repository is a study about Distributed Systems, where i and my classmate were developing a project for an UFRJ class. The idea of this class assignment was to study about Semaphores and Spinlocks where we developt it using golang.

## Implementations

### [Producer Consumer](https://github.com/DantasB/distributed-systems/tree/main/Trabalho_2/ProducerConsumer)

In this implementation we've learned about semaphores in golang and how to use it to implement a Producer Consumer program.

### [Spinlocks](https://github.com/DantasB/distributed-systems/tree/main/Trabalho_2/Spinlocks)

In this implementation we've learned about spinlocks in golang and how to implement it.

## Technologies

* Golang
* Go modules
